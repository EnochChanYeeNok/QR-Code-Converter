# QR Code Converter

QR Code Converter is a web-based application designed to simplify the creation and decoding of QR codes. Featuring a sleek dark-themed interface, the app offers an intuitive experience for users to generate QR codes from URLs and decode information from existing QR code images.

## How It Works

The application provides two primary functionalities, accessible through centrally aligned toggle buttons:

### Generate QR Code

1. **Input URL:** Enter the desired link into the provided text field.
2. **Select Error Correction Level:** Choose an appropriate error correction level to determine the QR code's resilience to damage.
3. **Generate:** Click the "Generate QR Code" button to create a QR code based on the entered URL.
4. **Download:** Once generated, the QR code image is displayed and can be downloaded by clicking the "Download QR Code" button.

### Decode QR Code

1. **Upload Image:** Select an image containing a QR code using the file input field.
2. **Decode:** Click the "Decode QR Code" button to extract the information embedded within the uploaded QR code image.
3. **Display Results:** The decoded information is displayed prominently, and the uploaded image is shown. If a QR code is detected, its location within the image is highlighted for visual confirmation. Even if no QR code is found, the uploaded image remains visible to the user.

This streamlined approach ensures that users can easily switch between generating and decoding QR codes without clutter, enhancing overall usability and efficiency.
